A chaotic system is any system where it is hard to predict the outcomes.  More specifically, making a small change in the starting state of the system results in unpredictable outcomes.  The classical example of a chaotic system is the double-pendulum, where the paths of the two pendula are hard to predict.

This experiment consists of a number of different possible experiments, including a mechanical chaotic oscillator, a double pendulum experiment, and some chaotic circuit experiments.
