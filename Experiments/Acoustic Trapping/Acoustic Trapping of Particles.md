Acoustic trapping using resonant sound waves to trap microscopic particles.  This is a technique used in biophysics to move cells and particles around, explore the forces between cells, and to create model tissue.
This experiment focuses on creating an inexpensive system to trap micron-sized polystyrene spheres in a small fluid cell.  You would be creating this from scratch.
