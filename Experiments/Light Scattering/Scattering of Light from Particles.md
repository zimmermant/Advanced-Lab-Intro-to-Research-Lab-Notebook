Light is one of the most powerful tools we have for exploring the properties of the world around us.  Particles that are smaller than the wavelength of light cannot be seen, but they still interact with the light and the behavior of the light scattering off these particles tells us quite a bit about the particles.

This experiment consists of several possible experiments that look at how light behaves when scattered off small particles.  These effects include Mie scattering, Rayleigh scattering, and the Tyndall effect.  You will be building these experiments from scratch.
